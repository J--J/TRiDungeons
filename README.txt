Script setup
------------
You need the following files:
 - Bosses.java
 - General.java
 - Dungeoneering.java
 - Monsters.java
 - Solving.java
Dungeoneering.java is the main class which contains the script manifest aswell.

The script won't do much when you run it, as it's currently in the progress of being made. You can edit it yourself though and give me suggestions on the development blog!
